run main21_02_23.m 

every file will be saved directly in your folder except for the summary tables.

(main21_02_23.m does not run AOVlearnings21_02_23 automatically: the analisys of variances of the learning steps is plot by Untitled19_02_23.m, 
you need AOVlearnings21_02_23 only if you want to plot the ANOVA tables summaries)

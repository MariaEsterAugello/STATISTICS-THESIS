# STATISTICS
statistical analysis and plotting of the results of my flight tests

run main21_02_23.m 

every file will be saved directly in your folder.

(main21_02_23.m does not run AOVlearnings21_02_23 automatically: the analisys of variances of the learning steps is plotted automatically by Untitled19_02_23.m, 
you need AOVlearnings21_02_23 only if you want to plot the ANOVA tables summaries)

watch out:
the small summary tables of the analysis of variance are not automatically plotted, you don't need them
